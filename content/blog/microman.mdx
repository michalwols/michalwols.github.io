Going from raw data to a production machine learning model is a long and laborious process. Managing it by hand is painful and error prone. 

## Goals

1. Make it easy to get started in a notebook or python interpreter
2. Just Python TM
2. Track execution time and artifacts
3. Avoid serialization between steps when possible
4. Run where you want, on your computer, github actions, kubernetes or anything else.


## Tasks

```python
from microman import task

@task
def download_data():
  pass


@task
def train_model():
  pass


@task
def full_pipeline():
  data = download_data()
  train_model(data)
```
