Yann is **yet another neural network** library that aims to make it easier to go from a quick training script to production. It provides glue code to handle common workflows that are not covered by PyTorch. 


### Goals

1. Stay out of your way
2. Make it easy to try different things
3. Help you avoid common bugs like forgetting to zero out gradients
4. Use what you need
